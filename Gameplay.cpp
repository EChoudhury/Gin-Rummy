For example, a three of hearts followed by a four and five of hearts is a meld, but if one of those cards were a different suit it would not count.  Additionally, an ace takes a value of one, so an ace two and three of the same suit is a run but a queen king ace of the same suit is not." << endl << endl;

cout << "Gameplay- Gin Rummy is played with two players.  The game is played with one deck of cards and there is a draw and discard pile, the draw pile being face down and the discard being face up.  Each player begins the game with 10 cards.  For the first turn, the first player can either take the first card from the discard pile or pass.  Every other turn after the first includes the player choosing to draw from either the draw or discard pile. That player must then discard a card into the discard pile.  The round ends either when the deck is out of cards (a tie) or if a player knocks.  A knock is when a player has at least three melds.  Any card that is not included in the melds is considered deadwood, and the players deadwood value is a total of all the face values of any card not in a meld." << endl << endl;

cout << "Scoring- When a player knocks, the deadwood value for each player is calculated and if the knocking player has less he receives the difference in deadwood as points.  If the other player has less they receive the difference in deadwood value in points, but also an undercut bonus of 25 points.  If a player knocks with 0 deadwood, that is a gin and they get 25 bonus points on top of the regular scoring.  If a player is able to include all 11 cards, that is a big gin and they receive 31 bonus points on top of the regular scoring.  The game continues until a player reaches 100 points." << endl << endl;
